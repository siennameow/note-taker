## Code Snippet üíª

JavaScript

API route DELETE to receive a query parameter that contains the id of a note to delete. It reads all notes from the db.json file, remove the note with the given id property, and then rewrite the notes to the db.json file.

```JavaScript
app.delete('/api/notes/:id', (req, res) => {
  
  fs.readFile('./db/db.json', 'utf8', (err, data) => {
    if (err) throw err;
    let notes = JSON.parse(data);
    notes.forEach(function(thisNote, i) {              
      if (thisNote.id === req.params.id) {
        
          notes.splice(i, 1)            
      }
})
```

API route POST receive a new note to save on the request body, add it to the db.json file, and then return the new note to the client. 

```JavaScript
app.post('/api/notes', (req, res) => {
  fs.readFile('./db/db.json', 'utf8', (err, data) => {

    if (err) throw err;
    var notes = JSON.parse(data);
    let addNote = req.body;
    addNote.id = uuid();
    notes.push(addNote);

    fs.writeFile('./db/db.json', JSON.stringify(notes), (err, data) => {
      if (err) throw err;
      res.json(addNote);
      console.info('Successfully updated notes!')
    });
  });
